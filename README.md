# Events App Documentation
This documentation provides an overview of the Events App, a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. 
In this project:
* Next.js is used as the framework for the React client, enhancing the performance and SEO-friendliness of the application.
* React DOM is employed for rendering the user interface, the useSWR hook is utilized for data fetching, Firebase is used for storing events data, Postman is used for API testing, and npm serves as the package manager.

## Advantages of Using Next.js
Next.js offers several advantages for building the Events App:

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js provides SSR out of the box, improving SEO and page load times.

**Efficient Routing:** Next.js simplifies routing, making navigation between pages seamless.

**Automatic Code Splitting:** The framework automatically divides code into optimized bundles, reducing page load times.

**Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js supports SSG, ideal for content-based apps like this one. Pages are pre-rendered at build time, enhancing performance and reducing server load.

**Built-in CSS Support:** Next.js offers built-in support for CSS modules and styled-components, simplifying styling.
